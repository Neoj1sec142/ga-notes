## My Advice To Other Junior/Entry-Level/New Grad Developers:

Find a way to make yourself different from the rest of your classmates, and fast! IMO the best way to do that would be learning different/other in-demand tech stacks or languages, but it could very well be a good story for why you're here now too.

Keep your LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, and GitHub polished and in-sync! If you don't have each one of those things, I'd recommend building them out. Every new application I built goes onto my Portfolio and GitHub profile. All new experience goes onto my LinkedIn and resume. Make sure your written skills convey what you want to!

Apply, apply, apply! When you're fresh outta school, it's a numbers game. Hit every posting on the job sites, but if it's a job you really want, also go to the company's direct website and look at their careers page to apply there. Hundreds of people hit the Indeed posting, but maybe only tens hit the careers page, so you'll have better odds.

Do small things that can help build your resume and portfolio. Take small gigs, volunteer to mentor other grads, build small projects, just do whatever to show people you're out there learning and coding.

Lean on your alumni community! Go to the meet-ups, network, and make friends who are in similar situations or careers. It's not always what you know, but who you know that could be the deciding factor.
